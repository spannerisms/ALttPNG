This entire repository contains tools designed to facilitate spriting for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on the SNES.

PNGto4BPP converts a composite PNG sprite sheet into a useable SPR file for importing into roms.

SpriteFilter imports SPR files, applies any one of a number of atrocious filters, and then exports to a new SPR for importing into roms.
